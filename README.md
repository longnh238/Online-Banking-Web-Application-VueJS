# Online Banking Web Application

## I. Abstract

This project introduces the development of an Online Banking Web Application designed to address the increasing demand for convenient digital banking solutions. With a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness, our platform consolidates essential banking services within a unified interface. 

The application is developed using the Java Spring Framework for backend services and Vue.js for the frontend, ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance optimization. Through personalized customization options and robust backend development, we empower users to efficiently manage their finances in an optimized digital environment.

## II. Introduction

Our Online Banking Web Application provides individuals with a unified, user-friendly banking experience. Responding to the growing demand for digital banking, we have built a platform that focuses on simplicity, efficiency, and personalization. Below are the key features of the platform:

### 1. Smooth Integration and User-Friendliness
The platform’s intuitive design and streamlined workflows make it accessible to users from various technological backgrounds. Whether users are experienced digital bankers or newcomers, the interface ensures easy navigation and financial management.

### 2. Essential Banking Services
Our platform offers a wide range of essential banking services. Users can:
- Conduct basic transactions (e.g., deposits, withdrawals)
- Monitor real-time exchange rates
- Access both internal and external transfer functionalities
- View detailed transaction histories
- Set daily transaction limits

These features provide a comprehensive and centralized solution for managing all financial requirements in one place.

### 3. Personalized Settings
What differentiates our platform is the ability for users to personalize their experience. Key customization options include:
- Setting balance thresholds
- Receiving email notifications when the account balance falls below a specified limit

These features give users greater control over their accounts and ensure timely awareness of potential issues.

## III. Frontend Development

### 1. Frontend Development with Vue.js
The frontend of the application is powered by **Vue.js**, providing a responsive and interactive user interface. This ensures that users enjoy smooth navigation and real-time updates while performing financial transactions and managing their banking information.

### 2. Vue Router for Client-Side Routing
We utilize **Vue Router** for managing client-side routing within the Vue.js application. It allows seamless navigation between different views or pages without requiring a full page reload, improving the overall user experience.

### 3. Axios for HTTP Requests
The **Axios** library is employed to manage HTTP requests from the Vue.js application to the backend server. It simplifies data fetching, manipulation, and handling of asynchronous operations, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

## IV. Conclusion

Our Online Banking Web Application is designed to offer convenience, functionality, and personalization. Whether managing day-to-day finances or performing complex transactions, users can enjoy a simplified and reliable banking experience. With its robust technology stack and focus on user satisfaction, this application is the ideal digital banking solution for today’s fast-paced world.
